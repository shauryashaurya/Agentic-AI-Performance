# Section 8 — GPU Awareness and System Resource Tracking
  
use `nvcc --version` (on Windows) commandline to check the CUDA version, then install the right PyTorch version for this part to work...

## 1. Purpose and scope

* System resource monitoring provides **context** for performance metrics and event sequences.
* In LLMOps, especially with local or hybrid serving, GPU availability, memory usage, and CPU load can directly impact agent performance.
* This section focuses on **lightweight, laptop-friendly instrumentation** for GPU and system resources that integrates with the same event emitter used throughout earlier sections.

## 2. What to track locally

1. **GPU availability** — whether a CUDA-capable device is present.
2. **GPU memory usage** — free vs total, measured periodically or at key points in the run.
3. **GPU utilization** — if available via libraries like `torch` or `nvidia-smi` (optional for minimal setups).
4. **CPU load** — average system load at run start/end.
5. **RAM usage** — free vs used system memory.

These provide baseline diagnostics and can explain sudden latency spikes or model failures due to OOM.

## 3. Emitting GPU availability and memory events

```
import torch

def emit_gpu_metrics():
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        free_mb, total_mb = [x / 1024**2 for x in torch.cuda.mem_get_info()]
        emit("metric", name="gpu_available", value=1)
        emit("metric", name="gpu_mem_free_mb", value=free_mb)
        emit("metric", name="gpu_mem_total_mb", value=total_mb)
    else:
        emit("metric", name="gpu_available", value=0)
```

* Call at run start and optionally every N seconds for long-lived agents.

---

## 4. CPU and RAM metrics

Use `psutil` (if available) for cross-platform support:

```
import psutil

def emit_system_metrics():
    cpu_load = psutil.getloadavg()[0]  # 1-minute load average
    mem = psutil.virtual_memory()
    emit("metric", name="cpu_load_1m", value=cpu_load)
    emit("metric", name="ram_used_mb", value=mem.used / 1024**2)
    emit("metric", name="ram_free_mb", value=mem.available / 1024**2)
```

* If `psutil` is unavailable, skip these or provide a warning.

---

## 5. Integration points in agent runs

1. **At `run_start`**

   * Capture a baseline of GPU, CPU, RAM.
2. **At each major span start**

   * Optional: detect transient resource drops before heavy steps (e.g., LLM calls).
3. **At `run_ok` / `run_fail`**

   * Capture end-state resource metrics to measure deltas.

---

## 6. Use in analysis

* **Correlate performance degradation** with GPU memory pressure or CPU load spikes.
* **Identify hardware limits** — e.g., GPU-free MB consistently below 500 → likely to hit OOM soon.
* **Explain variance** in latency metrics that is not explained by network or retries.

---

## 7. Testing strategies locally

* **Synthetic stress**: run a GPU memory stress test (e.g., large tensor allocation) during agent operation to verify metrics reflect the drop.
* **CPU stress**: run CPU-bound code (e.g., large prime computation) to simulate load.
* **RAM exhaustion**: allocate large Python lists to test memory metric accuracy.

---

## 8. Pitfalls and mitigations

* **Torch not installed with CUDA support**: `torch.cuda.is_available()` will be `False`; handle gracefully.
* **Multi-GPU**: current example checks only `cuda:0`; adapt for multiple devices if needed.
* **Permissions**: on some systems, reading system metrics may require elevated permissions.
* **Polling too frequently**: resource checks should be lightweight; excessive polling may itself cause load.

---

## 9. Takeaways

* System context is critical for interpreting performance metrics.
* Keep GPU/CPU/RAM monitoring optional but easy to enable.
* Integrate with the same emitter system so resource metrics appear in the same event stream as action and span events.
* Use these metrics in combined analysis (Section 6) to isolate environment-related performance issues.
